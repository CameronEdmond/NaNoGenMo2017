Welcome to our glorious nation!

This program will generate potential citizens for one of the greatest countries the world has ever seen. There is a catch, though: once an applicant is successful, one of their characteristics will be taken on board as a requirement for citizenship. That said, there is always a way around these kind of things, and our glorious leaders might be a bit more fickle than we'd hope...

Basically, if a citizen brings in enough "funds", then the requirements for entry can be changed. Permenently.

The version submitted here is seeking 21 citizens (starting with 1), and generated 22612 applicants to do so. Fittingly, the final entrant to the nation didn't quite match criteria, but was packing a healthy amount of dosh...

I probably won't tweak this any further, unless I find any typos, or I decide to produce a shorter version. 

This was a lot of fun!
